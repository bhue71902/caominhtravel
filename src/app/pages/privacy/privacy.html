            For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you
            to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The
            information that I request will be retained on your device and is
            not collected by me in any way. The app does use third party
            services that may collect information used to identify you.

            <h3 class="font-medium">(1) General Data</h3>
            <p>
              Generally, we do not automatically collect any personally
              identifiable information from you when you use our service. The
              only situation we may get access to your personally identifiable
              information is when you personally decide to email us your
              feedback or to provide us with a bug report.
            </p>
            <p>
              The personally identifiable information we may get from you in
              that situation are strictly limited to your name, email address
              and your survey response only. We guarantee that this personally
              identifiable information will only be used for contacting you and
              improving our services.

            <h4 class="font-medium">What do we collect?</h4>
            <p>
              We only collect the photos or facial images you explicitly upload
              into the app—no other biometric measurements or face-scan data are
              collected.
            </p>

            <h4 class="font-medium">How do we use it?</h4>
            <p>
              Uploaded images are encrypted in transit and at rest, and
              processed solely to apply your chosen AI filters or video
              templates; no facial landmarks, identity markers, or other
              biometric data are extracted or stored beyond this processing
              step.
            </p>

            <h4 class="font-medium">Data sharing &amp; storage</h4>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>
                No face images or related data are ever shared with or sold to
                third parties.
              </li>
              <li>
                Uploaded and generated images are stored on our servers for up
                to one day solely to assist with troubleshooting and are then
                permanently deleted; no other users or third parties can access
                them, and all data is kept secure and confidential.
              </li>
              <li>
                We only share anonymous, aggregated usage metrics (never image
                data) with trusted analytics partners.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="font-medium">Data retention</h4>
            <p>
              Face images and any data derived therefrom are retained on our
              servers for up to 1 day solely to support user troubleshooting or
              inquiries, and are then permanently deleted. Aggregated,
              non-personal usage metrics are retained only as long as required
              for service improvement and legal compliance.
